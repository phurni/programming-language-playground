# Programming Language Playground

This is a developer playground to gain knowledge and for experiments with computer programming language.

Initially inspired from https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch.

The first experiment is to create an **interpreter** for the language.

It is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT),
so feel free to fork it and run your own experiments.

## Project layout

* `doc`  
all the documentation describing the project.

* `example`  
code examples written in the _programming language_.

* `bin`  
binaries to run the different parts of the project.

* `src`  
source code of the implementation.

## Interpreter

The first experiment is the language interpreter, execute the `run` script to launch the interpreter,
pass the language source file as the first argument:

    bin/run example/fib.src

# Programming Language Playground

This is a developer playground to gain knowledge and for experiments with computer programming language.

Initially inspired from https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/a-compiler-from-scratch.

The first experiment is to create an **interpreter** for the language.
